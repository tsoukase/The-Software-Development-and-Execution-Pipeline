# Theoretical Computing Theory

A very short reference to computing theory.  
Note: The name '(Theoretical) Computer Science' is wrong as it is not science but it IS mathematics!

There are two fundamental concepts in mathematics, computers and literaly any human thought:  
* the static Information and
* the dynamic Change  
They succeed each other in that  manner: (D) -> (S) -> (D) -> (S) ...  

Computer theory studies them in full depth and, depending on context, gives them the following names:
* Data, structure, state, attribute, noun
* Algorithm, function, behavior, interface, verb  
As you are here, you are probably knowledgeable about these names :)   

Main topics are Formal Methods, Automata, Programming Languages, Data Structures, Information Theory, Computability and Complexity
